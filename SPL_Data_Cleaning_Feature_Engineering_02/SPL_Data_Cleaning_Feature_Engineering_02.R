### Cleaning

# Replacing a typo in CompetitionOpenSinceYear variable with a median
train$CompetitionOpenSinceYear = gsub("1900", "2010", train$CompetitionOpenSinceYear)
train$CompetitionOpenSinceYear = as.numeric(train$CompetitionOpenSinceYear)

# Replacing empty category in PromoInterval with 'missing'
train$PromoInterval = sub("^$", "missing", train$PromoInterval)

# Removing outliers
train = subset(train, !(Open == 1 & Customers < 1 & Sales < 1))

### Feature engineering

# Creating a starting date for Promo2
train$Promo2SinceDate = as.Date(with(train, paste(Promo2SinceYear, Promo2SinceWeek, 1, sep = "-")), "%Y-%U-%u")

# Creating a starting date for Competition (assuming it's from the first day of the month)
train$CompetitionSinceDate = as.Date(paste(train$CompetitionOpenSinceYear, train$CompetitionOpenSinceMonth, 
    1, sep = "-"), format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Replacing NAs in CompetitionSinceDate
CompetitionDateMissing = is.na(train$CompetitionSinceDate) == T & !is.na(train$CompetitionDistance) == T
train$CompetitionSinceDate[CompetitionDateMissing == T] = train$Date[CompetitionDateMissing == T]

# Create a new binary variable StoreAssortmentMatch
train$Assortment = as.character(train$Assortment)  # StoreType and Assortment have different levels
train$StoreAssortmentMatch = ifelse(train$StoreType == train$Assortment, 1, 0)

# Create a dummy variable for whether competition is present on a given day
train$CompetitionPresent = ifelse(as.Date(train$Date) < train$CompetitionSinceDate, 0, 1)
train$CompetitionPresent = factor(train$CompetitionPresent, levels = c("0", "1", "missing"))
train[is.na(train$CompetitionPresent), "CompetitionPresent"] = "missing"

# Create a new binary variable indicating if both types of holidays take place on a given day
train$StateHoliday = as.character(train$StateHoliday)
train$BothHolidays = ifelse(train$StateHoliday == train$SchoolHoliday, 1, 0)

# Replace NAs in newly created CompetitionDistance, CompetitionSinceDate, Promo2SinceDate
vars = c("CompetitionDistance", "CompetitionSinceDate", "Promo2SinceDate")

for (i in 1:length(vars)) {
    train[is.na(train[, vars[i]]), vars[i]] = mean(train[, vars[i]], na.rm = T)
}

# Fixing the datatypes of the logical variables
factor.vars = c("StoreType", "Assortment", "Promo2", "DayOfWeek", "Open", "Promo", "StateHoliday", "SchoolHoliday", 
    "PromoInterval", "StoreAssortmentMatch", "BothHolidays")
